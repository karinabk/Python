#Challenge

#Write code for two vectors with five values of your choice.
#The first should be written as a regular one-dimensional list. 
#The other should be be written with numpy.


import numpy as np
vector1=[2,1,3,4,-9]
magnitude1 = np.linalg.norm(vector1)
vector2 = np.array([2,1,3,4,-9])
magnitude2=np.linalg.norm(vector2)
magnitude2

'''You are given a positive integer N. 
Your task is to print a palindromic triangle of size N. 
For example, a palindromic triangle of size 5 is: 
1
121
12321
1234321
123454321
You can't take more than two lines. The first line (a for-statement) is already written for you. 
You have to complete the code using exactly one print statement. '''


for i in range(1,int(input())+1): #More than 2 lines will result in 0 score. Do not leave a blank line also
    print(r+=i*pow(10,i-1))
